Zaeem Khan -- SE350 Project
This project was developed in my Object Oriented Development class at DePaul University.
We used design patterns to make the code more easily readable. The program is a paint program
that creates 3 types of shapes (Rectangle, Ellipse, Triangle).
The program also contains copying, pasting, and deleting as well.
